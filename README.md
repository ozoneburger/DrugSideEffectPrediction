# DrugSideEffectPrediction

This repository contains the completed code from COMP701 Data Mining and Knowledge Engineering 2020 Assignment 1.
Short brief of what the code does:
DrugLib.py contains pre-processing steps and 2 algorithms trained on a 75 - 25 train test split that predicts the drug side-effect by using a combined reviews column.

!!NOTE: 
You will need to download the data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Druglib.com%29 in order for DrugLib.py to read the data set.
You will also need to download the following libraries from nltk and textblob. 

numpy
pandas
string
textblob = TextBlob
nltk.corpus = stopwords
nltk.stem = WordNetLemmatizer
